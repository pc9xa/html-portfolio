  A film by Greta Gerwig set in Sacramento, shows a quiet life for a teenager
  who romanticizes life and wants more.<br />
  Eventually she finds that life is not at all what it seems, and finds that
  life can be found where love is, in any shape, or interpretation.

  Yet another Greta Gerwig favorite, it is set in the imaginary Barbie World;
  but on a deeper scale, delves into the experiences of female millenials
  growing up, the expectations we put into ourselves and how, it probably wasn't
  all that necessary.
